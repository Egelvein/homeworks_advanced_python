### Task 1
**Task:** 

Asynchronous download of pictures\files from any site from https://thisxdoesnotexist.com/ or https://picsum.photos/ (the second one is better, as this site gives you unique pictures every time, instead of updating them once in 1 second):
- Make a python script that can be given a number of different files to upload to the right folder.
- Use aiohttp.
- Remember to avoid using blocking code when writing shuffles for asynchronous execution.

 
**Solution:**
Solution of this task are images in the folder ```artifacts/```
