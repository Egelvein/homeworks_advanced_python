# Linux utils

Here is the implementation of 3 linux command line utilities: nl, tail, wc

## Contents
- [nl](#nl)
- [tail](#tail)
- [wc](#wc)

### nl
**Task:** You need to implement a CLI application, apart from the code, you need to attach as artefacts a text file of how you tested the operability of your code (just a copy of the commands and outputs from the terminal)

- Write a simplified version of the `nl` utility -- a script that outputs numbered lines from a file to `stdout`.
- If no file is passed, the script reads the lines from `stdin`.
- It should work in the same way as `nl -b a`.

**Usage:** `python3 nl_util.py --textfile example.txt`. You can also use it with .py files in this folder or with your file.

**Example of working:**
